% TODO
% - Introduce 'CHL'?

% Introducing the subject: Ecosystem modeling
The study of ecosystem has increasingly relied on computer models during the last decades [ref]. They have become indispensable for designing observation networks [ref], interpreting data [ref] or estimating quantities of interest [ref]. Ecosystems can be, however, extremely complex, and selecting the right simplifications is a complex for the modeler, and very much depends on the question that need to be answered. 

% Introducting the subject: Chl modeling
My PhD work focused on the particularly challenging modeling of marine ecosystems. I worked on the modeling of phytoplankton, which plays a crucial role, as it is at the base of the marine food chain. Working with remote-sensing data of the Red Sea, I was trying to understand what affects the phytoplankton concentration, and to which extent we can predict its population in the future. 

% Outlining the introduction
Section \ref{intro:context} provides details about phytoplankton: its biology and importance (section \ref{intro:context:generalities}), the measurements of chl (section \ref{intro:context:sensing}), particularities of the CHL in the Red Sea (section \ref{intro:context:chlredsea}), and the different approaches existing for phytoplankton modeling (section \ref{intro:context:modeling}). Section \ref{intro:context} summarizes the main open questions that this thesis is adressing. Section \ref{intro:objectives} further details the expected contribution of this work. Finally, section \ref{intro:outline} introduces the different parts of the thesis. 

\section{Context}
\label{intro:context}

	\subsection{Generalities about phytoplankton}
	\label{intro:context:generalities}

		% Facts about phytoplanktons
		Phytoplankton are small, unicellular, photosynthetic algae. Thus they depend on the sunlight and mineral nutrients to survive. The three main types of phytoplankton are diatoms, coppecod, and cyanobacterias. Diatoms typically mesure between xxx and xxx, they are usually predominant in nutrient rich environments. Coppecod mesure between xxx and xxx, and are characterized by there motility. Finally, cyanobacterias are very small (xxx to xxx), and are able to survive in environments with very little nutrient, like the Red Sea. 

		% Role in Marine food chain
		Phytoplakton are primary producers: they produce biomass from their mineral nutrients. They are at the base of the marine food chain, and most of the marine life depends on them. They are therefore of crucial important to understand the marine ecology. 

		% Importance for fisheries
		Importance for fisheries

		% Role for climate
		Phytoplankton plays a crucial role for the earth climate. They trap CO2 during photosynthesis, and, when they die, they sink to the bottom of the ocean to form sediments. They therefore play the role of a biological pump. It is believed that their importance for regulating the climate is comparable to the land forests [ref].

	\subsection{Remote sensing of CHL}
	\label{intro:context:sensing}
		% In situ measurements
		Principles of in-situ measurements. Main types. Advantages: Column resolution, temporal resolution. Limitation: spatial resolution: impossible to see large scale phenomenons. 

		% History of CHL remote sensing
		When did chl remote sensing started. Why people got this idea. First missions and its results. Seawifs. Modis. New missions. 

		% Principles of CHL remote sensing
		Optical principles. Wavelengths. Max Depth. 

		% Processing of the data
		Different algorithms to process the data. 

		% Limitations
		Known limitations of chl remote sensing. Maximum CHL not visible. Low bathymetries. 

	\subsection{CHL in the Red Sea}
	\label{intro:context:chlredsea}

		As my PhD focused on the Red Sea, I will introduce here some notions about this peculiar environment and patterns of variation for the CHL in the Red Sea. 

		\subsubsection{The Red Sea}

			% The Red Sea physics
			The Red Sea is a remarkable marginal sea situated between Africa and the Arabic Peninsula and connected to the Mediterranean Sea through the Suez canal, and to the Gulf of Aden through the strait of Bab-el-Mandeb. It is one the most saline bodies of water in the world [ref] with a salinity of xxx. It also one of the warmest seas in the world, with surface temperatures between ... and ... [ref]. The average depth of the Red Sea is ..., but reaches ... in the trench that ranges it from north to south. This trench is the place where the Arabian and the African plates are drifing away [ref]. The southern Red sea is shallower (mean depht of ...) than the nothern red Sea (mean depth ... ).

			% Red Sea ecology
			The Red Sea is the northernmost tropical sea and is home to a unique but fragile ecosystem. xxxx different species of fishes where observed in its waters, from which ... species are endemic. Most of this biodiversity can be found in its .... km  of coral reefs [ref]. This unique resource is however threatean by human activities as the touristic exploitation and the economy develop along its shore [ref]. The impacts of the climate change on the coral reefs is also a subject of worries [ref]. 

			% Red Sea exploration
			To this date, the Red Sea has been relatively little studied. Political and economical difficulties have made it difficulties have prevented the deployement of long term and global monotoring mission. Research on this area therefore relies highly on computer simulations and remotely sensed data.
