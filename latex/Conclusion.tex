\section{Summary}

The author must provide an overall summary and discussion of the significance of the work. If the dissertation or thesis consists of relatively independent chapters, a unifying summary should be included at the end or beginning of the dissertation or thesis. Such a summary will be significantly more expansive than the abstract.
